# ECOMMERCE 

Created templates folder inside the app folder which is called store

Inside the templates folder is where I will store my html files:
Main.html → Template which all will inherit from
Store.html → Home page/store front with all products
Cart.html → Users shopping cart
Checkout.html → Checkout page
![firstnavbar](/readme-screenshots/templates.png)

Created views to render the html files 
![firstnavbar](/readme-screenshots/views.png)

Created STATIC folder to hold CSS files and images:
![firstnavbar](/readme-screenshots/staticfolder.png)

Now that I have set up the main template and added to the main CSS file, all I need to do is close out this section by finishing up the base styling for my 3 pages with placeholder data before I move on to setting up the database.

## Testing:
I was happy with my first attempt on creating the columns for the products and I used a placeholder picture to test how it would look on the site. I added the view and a "Add to cart" button features.
Here is the result:
