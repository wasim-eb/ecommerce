# ECOMMERCE 

Created templates folder inside the app folder which is called store

Inside the templates folder is where I will store my html files:
Main.html → Template which all will inherit from
Store.html → Home page/store front with all products
Cart.html → Users shopping cart
Checkout.html → Checkout page

Created views to render the html files 
*Screenshots of empty views*

Created the "url paths" to call these views.
*Screenshot of url paths*

Created STATIC folder to hold CSS files and images:


Now that I have set up the main template and added to the main CSS file, all I need to do is close out this section by finishing up the base styling for my 3 pages with placeholder data before I move on to setting up the database.
